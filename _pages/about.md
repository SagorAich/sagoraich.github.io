Computer Science and Engineering graduate at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), with a strong academic record and a growing focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. My research and project experience spans cutting-edge domains including Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Explainable AI, and Generative AI.

I have successfully authored and co-authored multiple conference and journal publications, with work appearing in IEEE conferences and under review at Elsevier. My research includes attention mechanisms for hyperspectral image classification, Bayesian neural networks for biomedical modeling, and innovative NLP applications for low-resource languages like Bengali.

I am highly proficient in Python, PyTorch, transformer models, and MLOps practices, with hands-on experience in fine-tuning LLMs (such as BERT and LLaMA), designing CNNs and RNNs, and applying XAI techniques like LIME and SHAP. I also have practical experience in web development using Flask and Bootstrap.

Alongside my technical strengths, I have pursued extracurricular interests in photography and leadership. I am passionate about using AI to solve real-world problems and am eager to contribute to meaningful projects and research collaborations.
