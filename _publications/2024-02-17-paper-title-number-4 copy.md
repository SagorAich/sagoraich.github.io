excerpt: 'Natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, particularly in improving question-answering (QA) systems for well-resourced languages such as English. However, the development of such systems for low-resource languages, including Bengali, remains insufficiently explored. This study proposes an approach to developing a Bengali QA system utilizing the Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct model, leveraging transfer learning techniques on a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD 2.0 benchmark. The experiments achieved an F1 score of 42.77%, marking a 4.02% improvement over the previous best performance of multilingual BERT (mBERT) variants. These results establish a benchmark against human responses and underscore the potential of transfer learning in advancing QA capabilities for Bengali and similar low-resource languages.'
