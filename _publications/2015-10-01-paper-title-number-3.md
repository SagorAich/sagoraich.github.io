title: "Distinguishing Human-Written and AI-Generated Text: A Comprehensive Study Using Explainable Artificial
 Intelligence in Text Classification"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This study combines Explainable AI (XAI) with a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification, using LIME to
enhance transparency. BERT achieved 100% accuracy, outperforming Random Forests, while LIME addressed inter
pretability challenges, bridging the gap between performance and explainability in AI systems.'
